				<section data-background-image="pics/Svoid.gif"><p class="fragment">The Beginning</p>
					<div id="named" class="fragment">The creation of the world began with the universe just being a mass of darkness and swirling chaos. There was nothing but endless dark water without form or purpose. Existing within this void was Heka! God of magic! Who alone awaited the moment of creation.<div>
					</section>
				<section  id="named" data-background-image="pics/magicOrb.gif"><p>Heka: The god of magic and medicine!</p>
					Also considered the personification of magic itself. He is probably the most important god in Egyptian mythology but is often overlooked. He is mentioned primarily in medical texts and magical spells and incantations and, because of this, was relegated to the realm of superstition rather than religious belief. Although he is not featured by name in the best-known myths, he was regarded by the ancient Egyptians as the power behind the gods whose names and stories have become synonymous with Egyptian culture.</section>
			</section>

			<section>
				<section id="named" data-background-image="pics/filler.gif">Out of this watery silence rose the primordial hill, known as the Ben-Ben, upon which stood the great god Atum. Atum looked upon the nothingness and recognized his aloneness and so, through the agency of magic, he mated with his own shadow to give birth to two children, Shu (god of air, whom Atum spat out) and Tefnut (goddess of moisture, whom Atum vomited out). Shu gave to the early world the principles of life while Tefnut contributed the principles of order.</section>
				<section id="named" data-background-image="pics/air.gif"><p>Shu: God of Air!</p>
					The son of the primeval god Atum-Ra. ‘Shu’ was the root of words such as ‘dry’, ‘empty’, ‘sunlight’ and ‘withered’. Shu is also known as the god of the atmosphere and of dry winds. Shu and Tefnut were also said to be but two halves of one soul, perhaps the earliest recorded example of “soul mates”.
				</section>
				<section id="named" data-background-image="pics/waterG.gif"><p>Tefnut: Goddes of Moisture!</p>
					The daughter of the primeval god Atum-Ra. She is the wife and sister of Shu, the god of light and air. She is the mother of Nut, the goddess of the sky and Geb, the god of the earth. She is the grandmother of Osiris, Isis, Nephthys and Set.
				</section>

			<section id="named" data-background-image="pics/universe.gif">
				Leaving their father on the Ben-Ben, they set out to establish the world. In time, Atum became concerned because his children were gone so long and so removed his eye and sent it in search of them. While his eye was gone, Atum sat alone on the hill in the midst of chaos and contemplated eternity. Shu and Tefnut returned with the eye of Atum and their father, grateful for their safe return, shed tears of joy. These tears, dropping onto the dark, fertile earth of the Ben-Ben, gave birth to men and women.
			</section>

			<section>
			<section id="named" data-background-image="pics/earth.jpg">The humans had no where to live however, and so Shu and Tefnut mated and gave birth to Geb (the earth) and Nut (the sky). Geb and Nut, though brother and sister, fell deeply in love and were inseparable. Atum found their behaviour unacceptable and pushed Nut away from Geb, high up into the heavens. The two lovers were forever able to see each other but were no longer able to touch. Nut was already pregnant by Geb, however, and eventually gave birth to Osiris, Isis, Set, Nephthys. Osiris proved himself a thoughtful and judicious god and was given rule of the world by Atum who then went off to attend to his own affairs.</section>
			<section id="named" data-background-image="pics/earthG.gif"><p> Geb: God of the Earth!</p>
				Husband to Nut, son of Shu and Tefnut. Geb was the god of the earth and guided the dead to heaven, he gave them meat and drink. He went on to become a mighty king and earned the exclusive title, "Heir of the Gods." Geb was so admired as a ruler, that the Egyptian throne was known by the epithet, "Seat of Geb."
			</section>
			<section id="named" data-background-image="pics/sky.gif"><p> Nut: Goddess of the sky!</p>
				Wife to Geb, daugther of Shu and Tefnut. She has many times been shown as a woman whose hands and feet touch the ground so that her body forms a semi-circle. As such she represents the heavens. Her arms and legs represent the four pillars on which the sky rests.

				<section><p class="fragment">The New Gods</p>
					<div id="named" class="fragment">Osiris administrated the world efficiently, co-ruling with his sister-wife Isis, and decided where the trees would best grow and the water flow most sweetly. He created the land of Egypt in perfection with the Nile River providing for the needs of the people. In all things, he acted in accordance with the principle of Ma’at (harmony) and honoured his father and siblings by keeping all things in harmonious balance.</div></section>
				<section id="named" data-background-image="pics/death.jpg">
					<p>Osiris: God of the Dead!</p>
				 The brother/husband of Isis and sometimes considered as the ledest son on Geb and Nut. He is the Lord and judge of the dead and is usually depicted as a mummy (symbolizing death). The Kings of Egypt were associated with Osiris in death – as Osiris rose from the dead so they would be in union with him, and inherit eternal life.
				</section>
				<section id="named" data-background-image="pics/blessed.gif"><p>Isis: Goddess of Magic!</p>
					Known as the "Mother of the Gods". The most powerful and popular goddess in Egyptian history. She was associated with virtually every aspect of human life. She was also the wife/brother of Osiris and gave birth to Horus the god of war.
				</section>

			<section>
			<section id="named" >His brother Set became envious of the creation, however, and also of Osiris’ power and glory. He concented a scheme to have his brother locked away into a coffin and hidden away...He succed and took the throne while also creating a lie stating that Osiris had died. Isis refused to believe this claim and with the help of her follwers found the former king's sealed coffin...In order to free Orisis Isis needed to create a special potion so she left the care of the coffin to her sister Nephthys.</section>
			<section id="named"  data-background-image="pics/sand.gif"><p>Set: God of Storms!</p>
				Set is often characterized as "evil", and did manifest many evil qualities, but was not regarded by the ancient Egyptians as an embodiment of evil or darkness. He was rather seen as a necessary balance to gods like Osiris and Horus who represented all things noble and good, fertility, vitality, and eternity. Set is best known as the world's first murderer in the Myth of Osiris where he kills his brother to usurp the throne.
			</section>
			<section id="named" data-background-image="pics/nepthy.jpg"><p>Nephthys: Mistress of the House!</p>
				The wife of Seth. The name "Nebt-het" means the "lady of the house." By "house" it is understood to be the portion of the sky where Horus lived.Since the earliest of times, Nephthys was considered to be Seth's counterpart and wife. She was always associated with him. Even so, she was depicted as the loyal friend and sister to Isis. It was Nephthys who helped Isis search for and rebuild Osiris' body
			</section>
		</section>

		<section id="named" >
			Unforuntely for Isis, Set had discovered her plans and teared open the coffin to cut Orisis body into 42 pieces and scattered his remais all over Egypt. Isis ccontracted her sister Nephthys help and then they began searching the land for Osiris’ parts. Wherever they found a body part, they would bury it on the spot and build a shrine to protect it from Set. In this way the forty-two provinces of Egypt were established by the two goddesses. They finally assembled all of the body except for the penis, which had been eaten by a fish. Isis then created a replacement part for the phallus and mated with her husband, becoming pregnant with her son Horus.

		<section data-background-image="pics/throne.jpg"><p class="fragment">Throne Wars</p>
			 <div id="named" class="fragment">Osiris had been brought back to life successfully by Isis but, because he was incomplete, could not rule the world as he had before. He instead descended to the underworld to become the righteous judge and ruler of the land of the dead. Horus was raised in secret to protect him from Set and, having grown to manhood, challenged his uncle for the rule of his father’s former kingdom. The battle raged for eighty years until Horus defeated Set and banished him from Egypt to dwell in the arid deserts.</div>
		</section>
		<section id="namedS" data-background-image="pics/horus.jpg">
			<p id="title">Horus: God of War!</p>
			 Horus son of Osiris and Isis, became one of the most important gods in Egypt. The kings of Egypt, with some exceptions, all linked themselves with Horus in life and with Osiris in death. The king was thought to be the living incarnation of Horus and, through him, the god gave all good things to his people. He is usually depicted as a man with the head of a hawk but is represented by many different images. His symbols are the Eye of Horus and the hawk.
